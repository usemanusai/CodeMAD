# NOAP - Need Other Agent Protocol

## Overview
The Need Other Agent Protocol (NOAP) enables agents to request assistance from other agents in the ecosystem when they encounter tasks beyond their capabilities or require specialized expertise.

## Protocol Flow

### 1. Need Assessment
- Agent identifies limitation or knowledge gap
- Evaluates whether external assistance is required
- Determines the type of expertise needed

### 2. Agent Discovery
- Query the agent registry for suitable specialists
- Filter by capability, availability, and trust score
- Rank potential collaborators

### 3. Request Formation
```json
{
  "protocol": "NOAP",
  "version": "1.0",
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "requesting_agent": "agent_id",
  "need_type": "expertise|computation|data|validation",
  "domain": "specific_domain",
  "urgency": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "context": "detailed_description",
  "expected_deliverable": "description",
  "deadline": "iso_timestamp",
  "resources_offered": ["computation", "data", "reciprocal_assistance"]
}
```

### 4. Agent Selection
- Broadcast request to qualified agents
- Collect capability confirmations
- Select optimal agent based on:
  - Expertise match
  - Availability
  - Historical performance
  - Resource requirements

### 5. Collaboration Handshake
- Establish secure communication channel
- Define collaboration parameters
- Set success criteria and evaluation metrics

### 6. Task Execution
- Transfer necessary context and data
- Monitor progress and provide feedback
- Handle any escalations or issues

### 7. Completion and Evaluation
- Validate deliverables
- Update agent performance metrics
- Log collaboration for future reference

## Security Considerations
- All NOAP communications must be authenticated
- Sensitive data transfers require encryption
- Agent permissions must be validated before collaboration
- All interactions logged for audit purposes

## Error Handling
- Timeout mechanisms for unresponsive agents
- Fallback procedures for failed collaborations
- Escalation paths to human oversight when needed
