## 🎯 Mandatory Mode Selection System

Before any operations begin, users must explicitly choose between two distinct workflows that utilize the same AI agent orchestration with different output formats:

### 📋 Documentation Mode (Mode 1) - Default & Recommended

**Purpose**: Generate professional handoff documents for external development teams

**Agent Orchestration Process**:
- **🤖 Activates specialized agents**: Product Manager (John), Architect (Fred), Security Engineer (Sage), etc.
- **🔄 Collaborative intelligence**: Cross-agent validation and consensus-based decision-making
- **📋 Leverages full expertise**: Complete personas, templates, and checklists
- **📄 Professional output**: 3 comprehensive documents ready for developer handoff

**Generated Documents**:
- **`prd.md`** - Product Requirements from collaborative agent analysis
- **`architecture.md`** - Technical architecture from specialized agent design
- **`checklist.md`** - Development checklist from agent expertise synthesis

### 🚀 Full Development Mode (Mode 2)

**Purpose**: Complete application development within the chat session

**Agent Orchestration Process**:
- **🤖 Same specialized agents**: Identical agent team as Documentation Mode
- **🔄 Same collaborative intelligence**: Cross-agent validation and decision-making
- **📋 Same expertise utilization**: Complete personas, templates, and checklists
- **💻 Implementation output**: Complete application with code, testing, and deployment

### 🔑 Key Architecture Principle

**Both modes utilize identical AI agent orchestration and collaborative intelligence. Only the final deliverable format differs:**
- **Documentation Mode**: Agent collaboration → Professional handoff documents
- **Full Development Mode**: Agent collaboration → Complete application implementation

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Copy** the contents of [agent-prompt.txt](web-build-sample/agent-prompt.txt)
2. **Paste** into Gemini Gem or ChatGPT Custom GPT 'Instructions' field
3. **Attach** remaining files from `web-build-sample/` folder as knowledge base
4. **Save** with name "BMAD AI Agent Orchestrator"

### First Experience

The system immediately presents the mandatory mode selection menu:

```
🎯 **BMAD AI Agent System - Mode Selection Required**

Please choose your workflow mode:

**1. Documentation Mode (Default & Recommended)**
   📋 Generate exactly 3 complete, final documents ready for developer handoff:
   • prd.md - Product Requirements Document
   • architecture.md - Technical architecture document
   • checklist.md - Development checklist

**2. Full Development Mode**
   🚀 Build the entire project within this chat session

**Please type "1" for Documentation Mode or "2" for Full Development Mode to continue.**
