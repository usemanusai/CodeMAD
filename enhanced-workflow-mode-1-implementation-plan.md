# Enhanced Workflow Mode 1 Implementation Plan
## Transforming Documentation Mode from Limited Agent to Comprehensive Team Collaboration

---

## Phase 1: Current State Analysis

### Current Workflow Mode 1 Structure
Based on analysis of the existing system:

**Current Limited Agent Approach:**
- **Phase 0:** Business Analyst (BA) - Project Briefing
- **Phase 1:** Product Manager (PM) - PRD Creation  
- **Phase 2:** Architect - Architecture Documentation
- **Optional:** Design Architect - Frontend/UI Specifications

**Current Final Documents Produced:**
1. **`prd.md`** - Product Requirements Document (from `prd-tmpl`)
2. **`architecture.md`** - Technical Architecture Document (from `architecture-tmpl`)
3. **`front-end-architecture.md`** - Frontend Architecture (from `front-end-architecture-tmpl`)

**Current Agent-to-Document Mapping:**
- **PM Agent:** Creates `prd.md` using `prd-tmpl` template
- **Architect Agent:** Creates `architecture.md` using `architecture-tmpl` template
- **Design Architect:** Creates `front-end-architecture.md` using `front-end-architecture-tmpl` template

**Current Workflow Sequence:**
```
BA (Project Brief) → PM (PRD) → Architect (Architecture) → [Optional: Design Architect (Frontend)]
```

### Identified Limitations
1. **Limited Expertise Input:** Only 3-4 agents contribute specialized knowledge
2. **Sequential Bottlenecks:** Linear handoffs create delays and context loss
3. **Missing Perspectives:** No security, performance, data, or quality input during planning
4. **Quality Gaps:** Limited validation and review from specialized perspectives
5. **Risk Exposure:** Critical considerations missed due to narrow agent involvement
