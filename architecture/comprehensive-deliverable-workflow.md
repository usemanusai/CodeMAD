# Comprehensive AI Agent Deliverable Workflow

## Overview

This document defines the coordinated AI agent workflow for delivering three comprehensive documentation files:
1. `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
2. `architecture.md` - Technical Architecture Document  
3. `tasks.md` - Comprehensive Task Breakdown Document

## AI Agent Coordination Principles

### Core Understanding
- **AI Agent Team:** This system coordinates multiple specialized AI agents, not human workers
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** Each AI agent brings specialized expertise to the project
- **Sequential Handoffs:** AI agents work in coordinated sequence with clear deliverable handoffs
- **Quality Gates:** Each AI agent validates inputs and outputs according to defined criteria
- **Context Preservation:** Critical information is preserved and passed between AI agents

### AI Agent Roles and Responsibilities

#### 1. Product Manager AI Agent (John)
- **Primary Deliverable:** `prd.md`
- **Specialization:** Product strategy, user needs analysis, requirements definition
- **Input Dependencies:** Project brief, user research, business requirements
- **Output Quality:** Complete PRD with clear epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria

#### 2. Architect AI Agent (Fred)  
- **Primary Deliverable:** `architecture.md`
- **Specialization:** Technical architecture, system design, technology selection
- **Input Dependencies:** Completed and approved `prd.md`
- **Output Quality:** Comprehensive technical architecture with clear implementation guidance

#### 3. Task Breakdown Specialist AI Agent (Taylor)
- **Primary Deliverable:** `tasks.md`
- **Specialization:** Task analysis, breakdown, and AI agent workflow optimization
- **Input Dependencies:** Completed and approved `prd.md` and `architecture.md`
- **Output Quality:** Detailed task breakdown optimized for AI agent execution

## Sequential Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Product Requirements Definition

**AI Agent:** Product Manager (John)
**Task:** Create PRD using `create-prd.md` task
**Duration:** 2-4 hours of focused AI agent work

**Process:**
1. **Input Validation:** Verify project brief and requirements are complete
2. **Requirements Analysis:** Analyze user needs, business objectives, and constraints
3. **PRD Creation:** Generate comprehensive PRD using `prd-tmpl` template
4. **Epic Definition:** Define clear epics with logical groupings of functionality
5. **User Story Creation:** Create detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
6. **Validation:** Run `pm-checklist` to ensure completeness
7. **Handoff Preparation:** Prepare technical context for Architect AI Agent

**Deliverable Quality Criteria:**
- Complete product vision and objectives
- Comprehensive user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Detailed feature specifications
- Clear business requirements and success metrics
- Technical assumptions and constraints documented
- Architect handoff prompt included

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture Design

**AI Agent:** Architect (Fred)
**Task:** Create Architecture using `create-architecture.md` task
**Duration:** 3-5 hours of focused AI agent work

**Process:**
1. **PRD Analysis:** Thoroughly review and understand PRD requirements
2. **Technology Selection:** Make definitive technology stack decisions
3. **System Design:** Create comprehensive system architecture
4. **Component Design:** Define system components and their interactions
5. **Integration Planning:** Plan API integrations and data flow
6. **Security Architecture:** Define security patterns and controls
7. **Validation:** Run `architect-checklist` to ensure completeness
8. **Handoff Preparation:** Prepare technical context for Task Breakdown Specialist

**Deliverable Quality Criteria:**
- System architecture overview with clear diagrams
- Frontend and backend architecture designs
- Database schema and data flow documentation
- Technology stack decisions with rationale
- Integration points and API specifications
- Security considerations and patterns
- Performance and scalability planning

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Task Breakdown

**AI Agent:** Task Breakdown Specialist (Taylor)
**Task:** Create Comprehensive Task Breakdown using `create-comprehensive-task-breakdown.md` task
**Duration:** 2-3 hours of focused AI agent work

**Process:**
1. **Document Analysis:** Review PRD and architecture documents thoroughly
2. **Epic Breakdown:** Analyze and refine epic definitions from PRD
3. **Story Enhancement:** Enhance user stories with technical implementation details
4. **Task Decomposition:** Break down stories into specific implementation tasks
5. **Dependency Analysis:** Map task dependencies and sequencing
6. **AI Agent Optimization:** Optimize tasks for AI agent execution capabilities
7. **Effort Estimation:** Provide realistic effort estimates for each task
8. **Quality Validation:** Ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements

**Deliverable Quality Criteria:**
- Epic-level breakdown of all project work
- Detailed user stories with enhanced acceptance criteria
- Frontend development tasks with specific implementation details
- Backend development tasks with specific implementation details
- Clear task dependencies and sequencing
- Realistic effort estimates for AI agent execution
- Definition of Done criteria for each task level
- AI agent assignment recommendations

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Inter-Agent Validation Points

#### PRD → Architecture Handoff
- **Validation:** Architect AI Agent confirms PRD completeness and clarity
- **Requirements:** All technical assumptions documented, epics clearly defined
- **Approval:** Explicit approval before architecture work begins

#### Architecture → Task Breakdown Handoff
- **Validation:** Task Breakdown Specialist confirms architecture completeness
- **Requirements:** Technology decisions finalized, system design complete
- **Approval:** Explicit approval before task breakdown work begins

### Final Deliverable Validation

#### Complete Documentation Set
- **PRD Validation:** Product requirements are comprehensive and clear
- **Architecture Validation:** Technical design is complete and implementable
- **Task Breakdown Validation:** All requirements are covered in actionable tasks
- **Integration Validation:** All three documents are consistent and aligned
- **AI Agent Readiness:** Task breakdown is optimized for AI agent execution

## AI Agent Coordination Protocols

### Communication Standards
- **Clear Handoffs:** Each AI agent explicitly confirms readiness to receive work
- **Context Preservation:** Critical decisions and rationale are documented and passed forward
- **Quality Confirmation:** Each AI agent validates the quality of received inputs
- **Issue Escalation:** Clear protocols for handling incomplete or unclear inputs

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Sequential Execution:** AI agents work in defined sequence with clear dependencies
- **Validation Gates:** Quality checkpoints between each AI agent phase
- **Feedback Loops:** Ability to request clarification or additional information
- **Documentation Standards:** Consistent formatting and structure across all deliverables

## Success Metrics

### Individual Deliverable Quality
