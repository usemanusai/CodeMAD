# Tiered Cognitive Cycle (TCC) Architecture

## Overview
The Tiered Cognitive Cycle (TCC) is the core "mind" architecture for advanced agents in the CodeMAD Cipher Architecture. It provides a structured approach to cognition through four distinct tiers, each with specialized cognitive components.

## Architecture Tiers

### Tier 1: Perception and Input Processing
**Purpose**: Raw sensory data intake and initial processing
**Components**:
- **Sensory Interfaces**: Text, audio, visual, and structured data inputs
- **Pattern Recognition**: Initial pattern detection and classification
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus allocation and priority assignment
- **Noise Filtering**: Irrelevant information removal

**Outputs**: Perceptual Packets containing processed sensory data

### Tier 2: Knowledge Integration and Reasoning
**Purpose**: Integration with existing knowledge and logical reasoning
**Components**:
- **Knowledge Graph Engine**: Fact storage and relationship mapping
- **Logic Engine**: Formal reasoning and inference
- **Memory Systems**: Working, episodic, and semantic memory
- **Contradiction Detection**: Consistency checking and conflict resolution

**Outputs**: Knowledge Graph Packets with integrated understanding

### Tier 3: Creative and Predictive Processing
**Purpose**: Hypothesis generation and creative problem-solving
**Components**:
- **Creative Engine**: Novel solution generation and ideation
- **Prediction Models**: Future state forecasting and scenario planning
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Pattern transfer across domains
- **Hypothesis Generator**: Testable prediction formulation

**Outputs**: Prediction Model Packets with creative solutions and forecasts

### Tier 4: Decision and Action Planning
**Purpose**: Final decision-making and action orchestration
**Components**:
- **Decision Engine**: Multi-criteria decision analysis
- **Action Planner**: Step-by-step execution planning
- **Risk Assessment**: Uncertainty quantification and mitigation
- **Goal Alignment**: Objective consistency verification

**Outputs**: Action plans and execution commands

## Cognitive Flow

```
Input → Tier 1 (Perception) → Tier 2 (Knowledge) → Tier 3 (Creative) → Tier 4 (Decision) → Output
         ↓                     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
    Perceptual Packets    Knowledge Packets    Prediction Packets    Action Plans
```

## Inter-Tier Communication
- **Packet-Based**: All communication uses standardized Cognitive Packets
- **Bidirectional**: Higher tiers can request clarification from lower tiers
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple tiers can operate simultaneously on different aspects
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous refinement through tier interaction

## Configuration Parameters
- **Processing Depth**: How thoroughly each tier processes information
- **Creativity Threshold**: Minimum novelty required for creative solutions
- **Confidence Levels**: Decision-making confidence requirements
- **Timeout Values**: Maximum processing time per tier

## Integration with Other Systems
- **ASE Integration**: TCC architecture templates for new agent generation
- **SIE Integration**: Simulation environment for hypothesis testing
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent storage of cognitive state
- **Communication Protocols**: Inter-agent collaboration capabilities
