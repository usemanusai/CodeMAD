# CodeMAD - Cipher Architecture Implementation

## Overview
CodeMAD (Code Multi-Agent Development) has been restructured to implement the sophisticated Cipher Architecture, featuring advanced agent systems, formal governance, and innovative cognitive architectures.

## Repository Structure

### ü§ñ agents/
Core agent system with sophisticated lifecycle management
- **classes/**: Base agent class definitions (SpecialistAgent, AuditorAgent, RegulatorAgent, EnforcerAgent)
- **instances/**: Individual running agent configurations and state
- **school/**: Training sandbox for new agents before deployment
- **tasks/**: Task definitions and workflows
- **templates/**: Agent configuration templates
- **checklists/**: Quality assurance and validation checklists

### üèóÔ∏è architecture/
Core technological innovations of the Cipher Architecture
- **tcc/**: Tiered Cognitive Cycle - the "mind" of advanced agents
- **ase/**: Agent Synthesis Engine - autonomous agent generation system
- **sie/**: Simulated Intervention Environment - computational imagination for causal reasoning

### üèõÔ∏è governance/
Formal governance framework with constitutional authority
- **constitution.json**: Supreme law of the ecosystem
- **dao/**: Human Governance DAO operational files and member registry
- **policies/**: System-wide policies enacted by the Sovereign Orchestrator

### üìä logs/
Transparency and auditability through comprehensive logging
- **audit_ledger.log**: Immutable record of all executive decisions
- **agent_actions.log**: Due process logging for agent sanctions and actions

### üß† memory/
Structured memory system using Cognitive Packet Protocol
- **shared/**: Collective knowledge verified by Auditor Agents
- **{agent_id}/**: Individual agent memory (knowledge graphs, episodic experiences, working memory)

### üîó protocols/
Communication and interaction protocols
- **packets/**: Cognitive Packet schemas (Perceptual, Knowledge-Graph, Prediction, Affective)
- **communication/**: High-level protocols (NOAP, PMPP, SLA safety protocol)

### ‚öôÔ∏è services/
System services and infrastructure components

### üìö docs/
Documentation and setup guides (preserved from original structure)

## Key Features

### Advanced Agent Architecture
- **Tiered Cognitive Cycle**: Four-tier cognitive processing (Perception ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Creative ‚Üí Decision)
- **Agent Classes**: Specialized roles with defined permissions and capabilities
- **Agent School**: Managed training environment for new agent validation

### Formal Governance System
- **Constitutional Framework**: Codified rules and principles in constitution.json
- **Human Governance DAO**: Hybrid Proof-of-Brain and Proof-of-Stake voting system
- **Sovereign Orchestrator**: Executive authority with logged decision-making

### Communication Protocols
- **Cognitive Packets**: Structured inter-agent communication
- **NOAP Protocol**: Need Other Agent Protocol for collaboration requests
- **Safety Protocols**: SLA (Stop Learning Agent) and other safety mechanisms

### Transparency and Auditability
- **Immutable Audit Ledger**: All executive decisions logged
- **Agent Action Logging**: Due process for agent management
- **Open Governance**: Transparent DAO operations and voting

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Constitution**: Start with `governance/constitution.json` to understand the system principles
2. **Explore Agent Classes**: Check `agents/classes/` for available agent types
3. **Understand Protocols**: Review `protocols/` for communication standards
4. **Check Architecture**: Examine `architecture/tcc/` for cognitive processing details

## Backup Information
A complete backup of the previous structure has been created at `backup_20250629_191509/` containing:
- Original `codemad-agent/` directory
- Original `web-build-sample/` directory  
- Original `docs/` directory
- All markdown files from the root

## Migration Notes
- All personas moved to `agents/classes/`
- Tasks, templates, and checklists moved to `agents/`
- Data files moved to `memory/shared/`
- Configuration files moved to `architecture/`
- Web build sample moved to `agents/instances/`

This restructuring aligns the codebase with the ambitious vision of Project Chimera while maintaining all existing functionality and data.
