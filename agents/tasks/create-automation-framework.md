# Create Automation Framework Task

## Purpose

To design and implement a comprehensive test automation framework that enables efficient, maintainable, and scalable automated testing across the application stack.

## Inputs

- Test Strategy Document
- Application Architecture
- Technology Stack Information
- Testing Tool Requirements
- CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Confirm Interaction Mode

Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed with creating the automation framework? We can work:
A. **Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** We'll design each framework component step-by-step, getting your feedback.
B. **"YOLO" Mode:** I can design a complete automation framework for you to review."

### 2. Framework Architecture Design

- **Framework Type Selection:** Choose appropriate framework pattern (Page Object Model, Keyword-Driven, Data-Driven, Hybrid)
- **Tool Stack Selection:** Select testing tools, libraries, and frameworks based on technology stack
- **Layer Architecture:** Design framework layers (test data, page objects, utilities, test cases)
- **Configuration Management:** Plan for environment-specific configurations and settings
- **Reporting Integration:** Design test reporting and result management system

### 3. Core Framework Components

- **Base Test Classes:** Create foundational test classes with common setup/teardown
- **Page Object Model:** Implement page objects for UI elements and interactions
- **Data Management:** Create test data management system with data providers
- **Utility Libraries:** Develop common utilities for database, API, file operations
- **Configuration Handler:** Implement configuration management for different environments

### 4. Test Execution Engine

- **Test Runner Configuration:** Set up test execution engine with parallel execution support
- **Environment Management:** Configure framework for multiple test environments
- **Browser/Device Management:** Implement cross-browser and cross-device testing support
- **Test Scheduling:** Set up automated test scheduling and execution triggers
- **Failure Handling:** Implement retry mechanisms and failure recovery strategies

### 5. Reporting and Analytics

- **Test Reporting:** Implement comprehensive test reporting with screenshots and logs
- **Metrics Collection:** Set up collection of test execution metrics and trends
- **Dashboard Integration:** Create real-time test execution dashboards
- **Notification System:** Implement test result notifications and alerts
- **Historical Analysis:** Enable trend analysis and test execution history tracking

### 6. CI/CD Integration

- **Pipeline Integration:** Integrate framework with CI/CD pipeline tools
- **Trigger Configuration:** Set up automated test triggers for different events
- **Environment Provisioning:** Coordinate with infrastructure for test environment setup
- **Artifact Management:** Manage test artifacts, reports, and evidence collection
- **Quality Gates:** Implement automated quality gates based on test results

### 7. Framework Documentation and Training

- **Setup Documentation:** Create comprehensive framework setup and configuration guide
- **Usage Guidelines:** Document how to create and maintain automated tests
- **Best Practices:** Establish automation best practices and coding standards
- **Training Materials:** Create training materials for team onboarding
- **Maintenance Guide:** Document framework maintenance and update procedures

## Output Deliverables

- **Automation Framework** (complete codebase with documentation)
- **Framework Setup Guide** (installation and configuration instructions)
- **Test Creation Templates** (standardized test case templates)
- **CI/CD Integration Scripts** (pipeline integration components)
- **Training Documentation** (team onboarding materials)
