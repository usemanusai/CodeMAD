# Vulnerability Assessment Task

## Purpose

To systematically identify, analyze, and prioritize security vulnerabilities across the application, infrastructure, and supporting systems.

## Inputs

- Application Architecture and Deployment Information
- Network Topology and Infrastructure Details
- System Configuration and Settings
- Previous Assessment Results
- Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Databases

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Confirm Interaction Mode

Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed with the vulnerability assessment? We can work:
A. **Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** We'll assess each system component step-by-step, discussing findings.
B. **"YOLO" Mode:** I can perform a comprehensive assessment and provide a complete report."

### 2. Assessment Planning

- **Scope Definition:** Define systems, applications, and networks to be assessed
- **Assessment Types:** Plan for network, web application, and infrastructure assessments
- **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate vulnerability scanning and assessment tools
- **Timeline and Resources:** Plan assessment schedule and resource allocation
- **Baseline Establishment:** Document current security posture for comparison

### 3. Automated Vulnerability Scanning

- **Network Scanning:** Perform network vulnerability scans to identify open ports and services
- **Web Application Scanning:** Conduct dynamic application security testing (DAST)
- **Infrastructure Scanning:** Scan servers, databases, and supporting infrastructure
- **Configuration Assessment:** Analyze system and application configurations for security issues
- **Compliance Scanning:** Check compliance with security standards and benchmarks

### 4. Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct manual testing of critical vulnerabilities
- **Business Logic Testing:** Test application-specific business logic for security flaws
- **Authentication Testing:** Manually test authentication and session management
- **Authorization Testing:** Verify access controls and privilege escalation protections
- **Data Validation Testing:** Test input validation and output encoding mechanisms

### 5. Vulnerability Analysis and Validation

- **False Positive Elimination:** Validate and filter out false positive results
- **Exploitability Assessment:** Analyze the exploitability and attack vectors for each vulnerability
- **Business Impact Analysis:** Assess the potential business impact of successful exploitation
- **Risk Scoring:** Calculate risk scores based on likelihood and impact
- **Vulnerability Correlation:** Identify related vulnerabilities that could be chained together

### 6. Risk Prioritization and Remediation Planning

- **Critical Path Analysis:** Identify vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk
- **Remediation Roadmap:** Create prioritized plan for vulnerability remediation
- **Compensating Controls:** Identify temporary mitigations while permanent fixes are developed
- **Resource Planning:** Estimate effort and resources required for remediation
- **Timeline Development:** Create realistic timelines for vulnerability fixes

### 7. Assessment Reporting and Tracking

Using the `security-assessment-tmpl` template, create comprehensive documentation including:
- Executive summary of security posture
- Detailed vulnerability findings with evidence
- Risk assessment and business impact analysis
- Prioritized remediation recommendations
- Metrics and trends analysis

## Output Deliverables

- **Vulnerability Assessment Report** (`docs/vulnerability-assessment.md`)
- **Risk-Prioritized Vulnerability List** (actionable remediation backlog)
- **Remediation Roadmap** (timeline and resource planning)
- **Security Metrics Dashboard** (ongoing vulnerability tracking)
