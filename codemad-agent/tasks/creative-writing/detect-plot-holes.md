# Task: Detect Plot Holes

## Overview
Systematically identify logical inconsistencies, narrative gaps, and plot holes in stories to ensure narrative integrity and reader engagement.

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive analysis of story elements to detect plot holes, logical inconsistencies, and narrative gaps that could disrupt reader immersion or story credibility.

## Prerequisites
- Complete story draft or substantial story outline
- Character profiles and established traits
- World building rules and parameters (if applicable)
- Timeline of story events

## Input Requirements

### Story Materials
- **Narrative Text:** Complete or partial story manuscript
- **Character Information:** Established character traits, motivations, and backgrounds
- **World Building Details:** Fictional world rules, magic systems, technology levels
- **Timeline:** Chronological sequence of story events
- **Plot Summary:** High-level overview of main story arc

### Analysis Parameters
- **Scope:** Specific sections or entire story to analyze
- **Focus Areas:** Character consistency, world logic, timeline accuracy, causality
- **Depth Level:** Surface-level or deep analytical review
- **Priority:** Critical plot holes vs. minor inconsistencies

## Process Steps

### 1. Initial Story Assessment
- **Read Through:** Complete review of provided story material
- **Element Mapping:** Identify key characters, plot points, world rules, timeline
- **Structure Analysis:** Understand story organization and narrative flow
- **Baseline Establishment:** Document established story parameters and rules

### 2. Character Consistency Analysis
- **Behavior Validation:** Check character actions against established personalities
- **Motivation Assessment:** Verify character decisions have clear, logical motivations
- **Development Tracking:** Ensure character growth follows logical progression
- **Relationship Consistency:** Validate character interactions remain true to established dynamics

### 3. Plot Logic Examination
- **Cause-Effect Analysis:** Verify logical connections between story events
- **Timeline Validation:** Check chronological consistency and sequence accuracy
- **Event Justification:** Ensure major plot points are properly supported and explained
- **Resolution Completeness:** Verify all plot threads are addressed and resolved

### 4. World Building Consistency
- **Rule Application:** Check adherence to established fictional world parameters
- **Internal Logic:** Verify world systems (magic, technology, society) remain consistent
- **Environmental Consistency:** Ensure settings and locations maintain established characteristics
- **Cultural Coherence:** Validate social and cultural elements remain consistent

### 5. Gap Identification
- **Missing Information:** Identify unexplained events or insufficient story details
- **Logic Breaks:** Detect breaks in story causality or logical progression
- **Contradiction Detection:** Find conflicts between established facts and story events
- **Inconsistency Cataloging:** Document all identified narrative gaps and problems
