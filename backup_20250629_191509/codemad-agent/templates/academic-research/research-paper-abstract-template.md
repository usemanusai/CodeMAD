### Section 3: Results (30-35% of word count)

**Purpose:** Present key findings clearly and specifically

**Content Elements:**
- Primary findings addressing research questions
- Key statistical results (with significance levels)
- Important patterns or relationships discovered
- Unexpected or notable outcomes

**Template Language:**
```
[Primary Finding]: Results revealed that [main finding with specific details].
[Statistical Results]: [Specific statistical results with significance levels].

[Key Relationships]: [Important relationships or patterns identified].
```

**Example Phrases:**
- "Results indicated a significant relationship between..."
- "Participants demonstrated significantly higher..."
- "Analysis revealed three main themes..."
- "The model explained [X]% of variance..."

### Section 4: Conclusions and Implications (20-25% of word count)

**Purpose:** Summarize conclusions and highlight broader significance

**Content Elements:**
- Main conclusions drawn from findings
- Theoretical implications
- Practical applications
- Future research directions (if space permits)

**Template Language:**
```
[Conclusions]: These findings suggest that [main conclusions].
[Theoretical Implications]: Results contribute to [theoretical understanding/framework].

[Future Directions]: Future research should examine [recommendations].
```

**Example Phrases:**
- "Findings suggest that..."
- "Results provide evidence for..."
- "These findings have important implications for..."
- "Future research should investigate..."

## Discipline-Specific Adaptations

### Empirical Research (Psychology, Education, Medicine)
- Emphasize methodology and statistical results
- Include effect sizes and confidence intervals
- Highlight practical significance alongside statistical significance
- Address generalizability and limitations

### Theoretical Research (Philosophy, Literature, Theory)
- Focus on conceptual contributions and arguments
- Emphasize theoretical framework and analysis
- Highlight novel insights and interpretations
- Address implications for field understanding

### Applied Research (Engineering, Business, Technology)
- Emphasize practical applications and solutions
- Include performance metrics and outcomes
- Highlight innovation and implementation
- Address real-world impact and benefits

### Review Papers (Systematic Reviews, Meta-analyses)
- Focus on scope and methodology of review
- Highlight synthesis and integration of findings
- Emphasize conclusions and recommendations
- Address gaps and future directions

## Quality Enhancement Strategies

### Language Optimization
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Employ precise, specific terminology
- Eliminate unnecessary words and redundancies
- Maintain consistent verb tense (typically past tense for completed research)

### Content Prioritization
- Lead with most significant findings
- Include quantitative results when available
- Focus on findings that directly address research questions
- Highlight unique or unexpected discoveries

### Flow and Coherence
- Ensure logical progression between sections
- Use transitional phrases to connect ideas
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout
- Create clear connections between objectives and findings

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Content Issues
- **Vague Statements:** Avoid general claims without specific support
- **Missing Elements:** Ensure all four sections are adequately addressed
- **Overstatement:** Present findings accurately without exaggeration
- **Irrelevant Information:** Include only information directly related to the research

### Technical Problems
- **Word Count Violations:** Strictly adhere to specified length limits
- **Poor Structure:** Maintain clear section divisions and logical flow
- **Inconsistent Terminology:** Use consistent language and definitions
- **Grammatical Errors:** Proofread carefully for accuracy and clarity

## Customization Guidelines

### Journal-Specific Requirements
- Review target journal's abstract guidelines
- Adapt structure to journal preferences
