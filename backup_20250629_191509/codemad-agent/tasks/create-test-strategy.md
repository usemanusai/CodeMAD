# Create Test Strategy Task

## Purpose

To develop a comprehensive testing strategy that defines the overall approach to quality assurance for the project, including test types, tools, processes, and quality gates.

## Inputs

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Architecture Document
- User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
- Technical Stack Information
- Quality Requirements and SLAs

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Confirm Interaction Mode

Ask the user: "How would you like to proceed with creating the test strategy? We can work:
A. **Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** We'll go through each testing area step-by-step, discussing approach and getting your feedback before moving to the next area.
B. **"YOLO" Mode:** I can produce a comprehensive test strategy document for you to review more broadly first."

Request the user to select their preferred mode and proceed accordingly.

### 2. Analyze Testing Requirements

- Review the PRD to understand functional and non-functional requirements
- Identify critical user journeys and high-risk areas
- Analyze the architecture to understand system complexity and integration points
- Document quality requirements, performance targets, and compliance needs
- Identify testing constraints (timeline, resources, environment limitations)

### 3. Define Test Strategy Framework

- **Test Pyramid Strategy:** Define the balance between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Risk-Based Testing:** Identify high-risk areas requiring focused testing attention
- **Test Types Coverage:** Specify which types of testing will be performed (functional, performance, security, usability, etc.)
- **Quality Gates:** Define criteria that must be met before code can progress through environments
- **Test Environment Strategy:** Plan for development, staging, and production-like test environments

### 4. Specify Testing Approaches by Type

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Coverage targets and measurement approach
  - Mocking and stubbing strategies
  - Test-driven development (TDD) adoption
- **Integration Testing:**
  - API testing approach and tools
  - Database integration testing
  - Third-party service integration testing
- **System Testing:**
  - End-to-end user journey testing
  - Cross-browser and cross-platform testing
  - Performance and load testing
- **User Acceptance Testing:**
  - UAT process and stakeholder involvement
  - Acceptance criteria validation approach

### 5. Define Test Automation Strategy

- **Automation Framework Selection:** Choose appropriate tools and frameworks
- **Automation Scope:** Define what should be automated vs. manual testing
- **CI/CD Integration:** Specify how automated tests integrate with deployment pipeline
- **Test Data Management:** Strategy for test data creation, management, and cleanup
- **Maintenance Strategy:** Approach for maintaining and updating automated tests

### 6. Establish Quality Metrics and Reporting

- **Key Quality Metrics:** Define metrics to track (defect density, test coverage, pass rates)
- **Reporting Strategy:** Specify how quality metrics will be collected and reported
- **Quality Dashboards:** Plan for real-time quality visibility
- **Defect Management:** Process for defect tracking, prioritization, and resolution

### 7. Create Test Strategy Document

Using the `test-plan-tmpl` template, create a comprehensive document that includes:
- Executive summary of testing approach
- Detailed testing strategy by type
- Tool and framework selections
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource and timeline requirements

## Output Deliverables

- **Test Strategy Document** (`docs/test-strategy.md`)
- **Quality Gates Definition** (integrated into CI/CD documentation)
- **Test Automation Framework Specification**
- **Quality Metrics Dashboard Requirements**

## Key Resources

- **Template:** `templates#test-plan-tmpl`
- **Validation:** `checklists#qa-testing-checklist`
- **User Preferences:** `data#technical-preferences`
